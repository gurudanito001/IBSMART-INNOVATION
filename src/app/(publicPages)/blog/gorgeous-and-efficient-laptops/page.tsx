            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5">10. Lenovo Yoga C940 (around 2019-2020)</h3>
            <p>This one was pretty clever because of its unique hinge that doubled as a soundbar. Imagine speakers that twist with your screen. This was perfect for watching movies or listening to music. It looked sleek and metallic, and it did a solid job for everyday tasks. It wasn&apos;t the fastest laptop, but it sure was efficient, stylish and handy.</p>

            <Image src="/images/gorgeous-and-functional/hp-spectre-x360-13.png" alt="HP Spectre x360 13 (around 2018-2021)" width={500} height={300} />
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5">9. HP Spectre x360 13 (around 2018-2021)</h3>
            <p>
              HP really started showing off with the Spectre x360. It had this cool, almost jewel-like design with sharp, angled edges, sometimes even in snazzy copper or gold accents. It was a laptop that could also flip into a tablet, giving you lots of options. Plus, the screen usually looked amazing, and the keyboard felt great to type on.

            <p>
            ASUS ZenBooks were always pushing to be super thin, and they often had this cool, swirling pattern on the lid that really caught the eye. What was extra special was sometimes they&apos;d have this &quot;ScreenPad&quot;, which was like a tiny second screen built right into the touchpad.This was pretty futuristic! They were compact but often surprisingly powerful.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5">7. Razer Blade 15 (various models, around 2018-2022)</h3>
            <p>
              Now, most gaming laptops look like they belong in a sci-fi movie with all their aggressive lines and lights. But the Razer Blade 15? It was different. It looked like a sleek, black block of pure sophistication, almost like a stealth version of a high-end designer laptop. Yet, under that calm exterior, it was a beast for games and heavy work.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5">6. Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 (2021)</h3>
            <p>
              The Surface Laptops have always been about clean lines and a feeling of premium quality. The Surface Laptop 4 really nailed this with its simple, elegant look, sometimes even having a unique fabric finish around the keyboard that felt super nice. It was just a solid, beautiful laptop that did everything you needed smoothly, with a great screen and a comfy keyboard.

          <div className="my-10">
            <Image src="/images/gorgeous-and-functional/dell-xps-17.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 17 (around 2020-2022)" width={500} height={300} />
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">5. Dell XPS 17 (around 2020-2022)</h3>
            <p>
              Imagine stuffing a huge 17-inch screen into a laptop that feels more like a 15-inch one ‚Äì that&apos;s the magic of the Dell XPS 17. It had those &quot;InfinityEdge&quot; screens with almost no borders, making the display just float there. Made from fancy metals and cool carbon fiber, it looked professional and could handle some serious heavy lifting, like video editing.
            </p>

          <div className="my-10">

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-5">4. Microsoft Surface Book 3 (2020)</h3>
            <p>
              This laptop was a true showstopper! The screen could actually detach from the keyboard base, and it had this wild, accordion-like hinge that was unlike anything else. It wasn&aposlt just a gimmick; it let you use it as a powerful laptop or a big, comfy tablet. The way it was built felt incredibly sturdy and high-end.

            <p>
              The Dell XPS 15 pretty much set the standard for what a great Windows laptop should be. Those screens with practically no border were groundbreaking when they first appeared, making the laptop feel smaller than it was. It mixed cool, machined aluminum with a soft carbon fiber touch, giving it a truly luxurious feel. This was a consistent favorite for anyone needing power in a gorgeous package.

            <p>
              This was a big moment for Apple. The 2021 MacBook Pro came back with a more &quot;serious&quot; and solid design, looking ready for action. But the real star was its stunning mini-LED screen (like an HD TV) and the game-changing M1 Pro/Max chips inside. It was unbelievably fast for tough tasks and lasted forever on a single charge. Pure power, wrapped in beauty.
